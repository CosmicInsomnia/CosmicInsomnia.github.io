### CPSC 120

* Lab 1
    - This was probably one of my favorite assignments this semester. I know it does sound basic to say the first lab is a favorite but I see it as the moment when I actually plunged into the world of ComSci. Instead of just reading or learning about it, I had the opportunity to participate directly and write up the code with my lab partners. When it comes to learning how to code, Hello World is typically the first project many beginners start out with.


* Lab 4
    - Lab 4 part 1 was the lab where we were to call functions from another file in order for the program we were writing to convert the volume we entered into the terminal. I thought that this was a good lab for myself because it really challenged me to actually think about how to use the knowledge I gained from learncpp and the lectures.


* Lab 10
    - It would be strange to call lab 10 one of my favorites but it proved to be extremely challenging to do. This was one of the labs where I really took the time with my partner to break down and understand what was being asked of us and how to implement that into the written code. Learning about 2D vectors was confusing at first but thanks to my partner, I felt a little more comfortable with using them after we finished. This is one lab I plan to revisit and redo to try and improve my own learning.
